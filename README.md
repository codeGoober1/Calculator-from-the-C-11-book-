Yes I am aware that C++11 is somewhat not really the best choice to use besides other versions like C++17 and C++20, but C++11 is the best way to learn the basics
in C++. This simple calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can also use pi and the e symbol. (which stands for exponent or power of 10).

And thats pretty much what I wanted to say about the calculator.
